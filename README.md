# Casa Tomada (House Taken Over) - Unreal Engine 5 Project

**Genre**: Atmospheric Horror  
**Setting**: Argentina, mid-20th Century  
**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5

## Overview

**Casa Tomada** is an atmospheric horror game inspired by Julio Cort√°zar's short story "Casa Tomada," analog horror, and indie games that use horror as a narrative tool. The game immerses players in a creeping existential horror as they explore an old mansion inherited by the protagonist's family, set in Argentina in the mid-20th century.

Players will live through a dual experience as they explore the mansion during the day, piecing together the family's history, and struggle to survive the night as the house is slowly taken over by a mysterious presence.
