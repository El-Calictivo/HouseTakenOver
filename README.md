# Casa Tomada (House Taken Over) - Unreal Engine 5 Project

**Genre**: Atmospheric Horror  
**Setting**: Argentina, mid-20th Century  
**Engine**: Unreal Engine 5

## Overview

**Casa Tomada** is an atmospheric horror game inspired by Julio Cort√°zar's short story "Casa Tomada," analog horror, and indie games that use horror as a narrative tool. The game immerses players in a creeping existential horror as they explore an old mansion inherited by the protagonist's family, set in Argentina in the mid-20th century.

Players will live through a dual experience as they explore the mansion during the day, piecing together the family's history, and struggle to survive the night as the house is slowly taken over by a mysterious presence.

## Gameplay

### The House by Day
During daylight, players engage in introspective exploration of the mansion, uncovering its secrets and the protagonist's personal history. These brief moments of respite provide a window for players to discover clues that might be key to escaping the looming horror of the night.

### The House by Night
The core gameplay loop. As night falls, the atmosphere shifts to one of terror. The house becomes hostile, with rooms slowly being "taken" by a malevolent force. Players must manage the house's safety, deciding when to prevent the loss of rooms and when to seal off those that are beyond saving. At the same time, the player receives eerie coded messages through a telephone, which may hold the key to understanding and surviving the night.

### External Messages
During the night, coded messages arrive via the protagonist's phone line, adding depth to the story and reflecting events both inside the house and in the world outside. Decoding these messages is vital to uncover the true nature of the menace and the character's personal journey.
